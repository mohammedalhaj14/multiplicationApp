**Elevate Your Mathematics ✨**

**MathPro** has evolved from a simple multiplication app into a high-performance, multi-functional learning tool. Designed with a sleek "Glassmorphism" aesthetic, it challenges users across four mathematical disciplines with real-time pressure and instant corrective feedback.

## 🛠️ New Pro Features

-   **Dynamic Math Engine:** Switch seamlessly between **Addition (+)**, **Subtraction (−)**, **Multiplication (×)**, and **Division (÷)**.
-   **Intelligent Quiz Mode:** A randomized gauntlet that tests your speed and accuracy across all operators simultaneously.
-   **Temporal Pressure (Timer):** Quiz mode features a 30-second countdown per question, leveraging a visual progress bar that turns red as time runs out.
-   **Zero-Decimal Division:** The engine is precision-engineered to only generate whole-number division problems for a frustration-free experience.
-   **Instant Corrective Feedback:** If you miss an answer, the system instantly reveals the correct solution, facilitating faster learning.
-   **Session-Based Scoring:** A clean slate every time you start. Your score resets to zero on refresh, perfect for competitive classroom sessions.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Select Mode:** Choose a specific operator for practice or hit **"Quiz"** for a timed challenge.
2.  **Solve:** You have 30 seconds (in Quiz mode) to input the correct value.
3.  **Feedback:** * **Correct:** Score increases, and the UI flashes green.
    * **Wrong/Timeout:** Score decreases, and the correct answer is revealed in red.
4.  **Beat the Clock:** Watch the top progress bar—speed is just as important as accuracy!



## 💻 Technical Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Flexbox & Clamp for full responsiveness).
-   **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
-   **UI Design:** Modern Dark Mode with `backdrop-filter` glass effects and hardware-accelerated animations.
-   **State Management:** Centralized JavaScript `state` object for consistent session handling.
